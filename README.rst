=====================
Cantal Client Library
=====================

:Status: Alpha
:Documentation: http://docs.rs/tk-cantal/


A client for cantal_ monitoring service. This is not for submitting metrics
to the cantal. This library is for **accessing** metrics that cantal tracks.

Because cantal_ has no stable public API yet, this uses private APIs which may
break compatibility at any moment.
